//! # Parachain Staking
//! Minimal staking pallet that implements collator selection by total backed
//! stake. The main difference between this pallet and `frame/pallet-staking` is
//! that this pallet uses direct delegation. Delegators choose exactly who they
//! delegate and with what stake. This is different from `frame/pallet-staking`
//! where you approval vote and then run Phragmen.
//!
//! ### Rules
//! There is a new round every `BlocksPerRound` blocks.
//!
//! At the start of every round,
//! * issuance is distributed to collators for `StakeDuration` rounds ago
//! in proportion to the points they received in that round (for authoring
//! blocks)
//! * queued collator exits are executed
//! * a new set of collators is chosen from the candidates
//!
//! To join the set of candidates, an account must call `join_candidates` with
//! stake >= `MinCollatorCandidateStk` and fee <= `MaxFee`. The fee is taken off
//! the top of any rewards for the collator before the remaining rewards are
//! distributed in proportion to stake to all delegators (including the
//! collator, who always self-delegates).
//!
//! To leave the set of candidates, the collator calls `leave_candidates`. If
//! the call succeeds, the collator is removed from the pool of candidates so
//! they cannot be selected for future collator sets, but they are not unstaked
//! until `StakeDuration` rounds later. The exit request is stored in the
//! `ExitQueue` and processed `StakeDuration` rounds later to unstake the
//! collator and all of its delegators.
//!
//! To join the set of delegators, an account must call `join_delegators` with
//! stake >= `MinDelegatorStk`. There are also runtime methods for delegating
//! additional collators and revoking delegations.
